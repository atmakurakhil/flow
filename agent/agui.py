        The adapter's own emitter is reused rather than reimplemented: it

        `prepare_regenerate_stream` — which it enters on a message-shape

        `time_travel_checkpoint.values` and reads neither `input.state` nor the
        forwarded properties. A turn taking that path used to run as whoever
        spoke when that checkpoint was written.

        thread per conversation: from the second turn on, the transcript arrives
        carrying ids the checkpoint has never seen, which is exactly what the
        heuristic reads as an edit.

        input keys before handing it to LangGraph, and it learns those keys by
        introspecting the graph. That introspection has a documented
        warning-only fallback — an older LangGraph, a custom graph class, a
        Pydantic skew — and the fallback answer is a fixed list that does not
        include `channel_actor`.

        On that path the key this class writes on every run is filtered back
        out, and the run reaches a checkpointed graph without it. An absent key
        is not a cleared key: the previous speaker's identity stands, and an
        anonymous turn runs in their connected accounts. Worse, the raw
        forwarded properties are merged *under* the filtered payload, so what
        does arrive is the untrimmed `ProviderActor` — display name and work
        address included — instead of the three fields `personal_actor` keeps.

        Adding the key back is not a widening of what the graph accepts:
        `ComposioAgentState` declares it, so on the introspection path it is
        already there. This only makes the fallback agree with the schema
        instead of silently disagreeing with it. Refusing the run would also
        clear the actor, but it would take the whole deployment down for a
        best-effort introspection failure that costs nothing else.
