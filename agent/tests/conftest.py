"""Keep the machine's own configuration out of the tests.

`agent.py` calls `load_dotenv()` at import, so importing anything that reaches
it copies the repo's real `.env` into `os.environ` — API keys, Slack tokens and
the toolkit lists. Every test in this suite then runs against whatever that
developer happens to have configured today, and an exported shell variable does
the same thing without any `.env` at all.

That is not hypothetical, and it has now happened twice. `COMPOSIO_USER_TOOLKITS`
gained `linear` while testing a live Slack workspace and
`test_the_process_environment_still_wins_over_the_env_file` began failing —
correctly, because the connect script refuses to mint a shared link for a
toolkit configured as personal. Then `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`, which this fixture
did not cover because it cleared the `COMPOSIO_` prefix only, made
`test_a_browser_preflight_is_answered_rather_than_refused` fail with
`assert 400 == 200`: the app under test had a CORS policy the test never asked
for.

So the scrub is the whole class, not one prefix:

* every variable this agent's own code reads — the list below, grouped by what
  it configures. Each one decides which tools exist, whose account a call runs
  in, which credentials are found, or whether a feature is constructed at all.
  A test that wants one sets it, which is the only way its intent is visible in
  the test itself;
* plus every name defined in the repo's `.env`, read from the very file
  `agent.py` loads. That half needs no maintenance: a variable added to a
  developer's `.env` tomorrow is cleared tomorrow, including one this agent
  does not read yet.

Still a deny-list rather than a wholesale scrub of `os.environ`: PATH, HOME and
the virtualenv are what make the suite runnable at all.

One variable cannot be cleared per test at all. `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is read
once, when `main` is imported, so by the time a test runs the policy is already
built. It is pinned for the session below rather than deleted: `load_dotenv()`
fills in any name absent from `os.environ`, so deleting it hands the decision
straight back to the developer's `.env`.
