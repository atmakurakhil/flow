# Registration order is load-bearing, and it reads backwards: Starlette builds
# the stack so that the middleware added *last* sits outermost. CORS must be the
# outer one. Added first — the way this file used to have it — the secret check
# wraps CORS, and then a browser preflight, which carries no `Authorization`
# because asking whether it may send one is the entire point of a preflight, is
# refused before CORS ever runs. Every 401 also loses its CORS headers, so a
# browser reports an opaque CORS failure instead of the status, and
# `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is inert exactly where an operator with a wrong secret
# needs to read it.
